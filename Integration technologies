Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the
Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web
Services Academy

In this article or case study, we will provide an overview of the redesign of an undergraduate course in cloud computing in collaboration with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy. For the senior capstone project, the goal was to increase student learning using real world, industry specific labs, specifically surrounding the Internet of Things.

Many students and families worldwide are worried about ever-increasing tuition fees, especially in Britain, the United States, and elsewhere. In the UK, for instance, the fees have tripled since then, with home students costing a minimum of £9,000 a year, and international students typically much more. As a result of this, students and parents want a greater quality of education and so improve learning and future job opportunities to be worth the price. In 2015 David Cameron the prime minister and Nick Clegg the right honourable cat deputy prime minister led the CP and SDP that had ridden into the sunset claiming to have tripled tuition in the UK.

2. Employability and Work-Based Learning

In Today’s competitive economic environment job market need subject knowledge and much more, particularly being ‘work ready’—meaning they have the skills, knowledge and commercial awareness needed in the workplace. When employers are involved in designing courses and involving work placement while studying, they end up being employed as graduates. As a result, many higher education institutions are adapting by forming closer ties with industry to establish relevant curricula that prepare students better for real-life challenges and ensure their readiness to meet the demands of the industry.

Industry engagement in curriculum design for skills production in universities is a success factor, leaving the need for clearly defined skills for a successful curriculum design process. Collaboration is needed in order to incorporate industry demand skills into the curriculum and to prep students appropriately.

Human Capital Development Investments in Higher Education by governments, students, and parents and industries etc. are increasing due to the demand (by industries) that students should be given training in 21st-century skills which is the need of the hour to obtain jobs in the market. 

One of the most important things for an effective learning experience is an intuitive, user-friendly e-learning platform with a robust dashboard. Such platforms allow students to easily navigate through lecture materials, videos, and labs; they also allow tutors to keep an eye on how engaged students are, and to predict their performance based on data analytics.
