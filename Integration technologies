Enhancing Student Employability in Collaboration with the
Industry: Case Study of a Partnership with Amazon Web
Services Academy

In this article or case study, we will provide an overview of the redesign of an undergraduate course in cloud computing in collaboration with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Academy. For the senior capstone project, the goal was to increase student learning using real world, industry specific labs, specifically surrounding the Internet of Things.

Many students and families worldwide are worried about ever-increasing tuition fees, especially in Britain, the United States, and elsewhere. In the UK, for instance, the fees have tripled since then, with home students costing a minimum of £9,000 a year, and international students typically much more. As a result of this, students and parents want a greater quality of education and so improve learning and future job opportunities to be worth the price. In 2015 David Cameron the prime minister and Nick Clegg the right honourable cat deputy prime minister led the CP and SDP that had ridden into the sunset claiming to have tripled tuition in the UK.


In Today’s competitive economic environment job market need subject knowledge and much more, particularly being ‘work ready’—meaning they have the skills, knowledge and commercial awareness needed in the workplace. When employers are involved in designing courses and involving work placement while studying, they end up being employed as graduates. As a result, many higher education institutions are adapting by forming closer ties with industry to establish relevant curricula that prepare students better for real-life challenges and ensure their readiness to meet the demands of the industry.

Industry engagement in curriculum design for skills production in universities is a success factor, leaving the need for clearly defined skills for a successful curriculum design process. Collaboration is needed in order to incorporate industry demand skills into the curriculum and to prep students appropriately.

Human Capital Development Investments in Higher Education by governments, students, and parents and industries etc. are increasing due to the demand (by industries) that students should be given training in 21st-century skills which is the need of the hour to obtain jobs in the market. 

One of the most important things for an effective learning experience is an intuitive, user-friendly e-learning platform with a robust dashboard. Such platforms allow students to easily navigate through lecture materials, videos, and labs; they also allow tutors to keep an eye on how engaged students are, and to predict their performance based on data analytics.

Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) has taken alignment as the basis for its curriculum design; alignment to its vision and mission, to four themes (people, education, public engagement and sustainability) around which the university has focused on during its strategy as well as alignment with the curriculum itself. Using the AWS Academy LMS, our collaboration with AWS Academy develops skills for our students while giving them experience to better their careers. The curriculum covers theory in the area of distributed computing followed by lab work on virtualization, scalability, big data and monitoring systems which is worth 25% of the exam marks. The study also includes employability-focused teaching, exploring career pathways in cloud computing and skills to acquire.

Figure 1 outlines the link between learners, HEIs and employers with regard to employability skills. Although there are many career paths available in cloud computing, this study focuses on nine popular such careers as shown in Table 1. The following table describes the career pathways and the training and skills students will need to be successful in each path.


Table 1 identifies some of the most well-known career paths in cloud computing, the necessary training, knowledge prerequisites and average salaries per role:

Cloud Solution Architect: Average salary £101,000, Needs SOA, web services, system scripting

Cloud Network Engineer: Average Salary: £77,000, Requires specialist knowledge — in Network technologies and VMware.

Cloud Developer: Skills in middleware, SOA, and object-oriented programming, average £86,500 per year.

Big Data Engineer: database technologies knowledge with SQL/NoSQL and statistical tools (average £77,500)

DevOps Engineer: SOA, web services, object-oriented programming, average salary £90k.

It involves placing industry cloud technology into the curriculum for students to enhance hands-on learning while exploring how industrial attachment industrial attachments can also benefit cloud computing lecturers acquire AWEC certification professional courses which serve as a pillar for the future. To incorporate AWS into the cloud computing module, the lecturer signed in to AWS Academy’s Cloud Foundations program. After 12 weeks of study on the subjects, the lecturer took the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (ACCP) practice exam, using a free AWS voucher. AWS also asked the lecturers to attend a short online workshop that directed them on how to update and move through the needed resources before taking the certification exam.

All of these require problem-solving and the ability to learn new IT skills.
